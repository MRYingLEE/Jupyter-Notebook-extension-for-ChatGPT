## To make Jupyter Notebook a general client for ChatGPT 
So the target users are not data science analysts/engineers only, but all advanced users, who want to use ChatGPT not only for chatting.

## Technically, the extension is based on the official ChatGPT API (Gpt-3.5-turbo so far)

## The development is still in progress.
